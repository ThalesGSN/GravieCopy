# GravieCopy

A secure, native macOS clipboard manager built for handling sensitive healthcare data. Designed for LGPD/HIPAA-conscious workflows — everything stays local, nothing leaves the device.

## Features

- **AES-256 encrypted vault** — clipboard history stored in SQLCipher-encrypted SQLite; no plaintext ever hits the disk
- **Touch ID unlock** — derived key stored in Keychain with biometric access control; no password typing after first setup
- **PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation** — 100k iterations; master password is never stored
- **Auto-lock** — vault locks automatically after configurable inactivity (5 min → Never)
- **Ephemeral retention** — unpinned items auto-purged after a configurable window (12 h → Keep forever)
- **App blacklist** — ignores clipboard changes when password managers or other sensitive apps are in focus
- **Global hotkey** — `Cmd+Shift+V` opens the panel over any active window (Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`, no extra permissions)
- **Auto-paste** — selects an item, restores focus to your previous app, and injects `Cmd+V` via `CGEvent`
- **In-memory search** — full-text search runs entirely in RAM on decrypted content
- **Pinned items** — pin frequently used templates; they survive the retention purge
- **Plain-text strip** — paste RTF content as plain text with one toggle
- **Zero telemetry** — no network permissions, no crash reporting, no analytics
- **Supports** plain text, RTF, and images

---

## Requirements

- macOS 14 Sonoma or later
- Xcode 16+
- CocoaPods (`gem install cocoapods`)

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThalesGSN/GravieCopy.git
cd GravieCopy
pod install
open GravieCopy.xcworkspace
```

Build and run with `Cmd+R` in Xcode. The app installs as a menu bar icon with no Dock entry.

> **First launch:** you'll be prompted to create a master password. This derives the AES-256 key via PBKDF2 and stores it in your Keychain behind Touch ID for subsequent unlocks.

### Security model

| Layer | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Encryption at rest | SQLCipher AES-256 (raw key, bypasses SQLCipher's own KDF) |
| Key derivation | PBKDF2-SHA256, 100k iterations, 32-byte salt (excluded from iCloud) |
| Key storage | Keychain `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` + `.userPresence` |
| Auto-lock | Cancellable `Task.sleep`; also locks on idle timeout |
| Capture blacklist | Checked against `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication.bundleIdentifier` on every poll |
| Network | None — `com.apple.security.network.client` entitlement is absent |

---

## Dependencies

Managed via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org):

| Pod | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [GRDB.swift/SQLCipher](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift) | SQLite ORM + SQLCipher encryption |

---

## Settings

Open **Settings** (`Cmd+,` while the panel is active):

- **Auto-lock after** — 5 min / 15 min / 30 min / 1 h / 4 h / Never
- **Retain history for** — 12 h / 24 h / 48 h / 7 days / Keep forever
- **Blocked Apps** — add bundle IDs manually or pick from running apps; built-in defaults include 1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass, Zoom
